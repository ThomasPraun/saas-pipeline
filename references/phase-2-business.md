# Phase 2: Business Model

## Objective

Define a sustainable business model with clear revenue streams, pricing strategy, and unit economics.

## Skills

| Order | Skill | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | business-model-canvas | Map all 9 building blocks of the business |
| 2 | startup-business-models | Define pricing model, tiers, and unit economics |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Business Model Canvas

Delegate to `business-model-canvas` with the Phase 1 design document (`docs/plans/{project-name}-design.md`).

Target: canvas score >= 60. If below, iterate on weak blocks before proceeding.

### Step 2: Pricing and Unit Economics

Delegate to `startup-business-models` with the canvas output.

### Step 3: Save Documents

```
docs/business/
  business-model-canvas.md
  pricing-strategy.md
```

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Business Model Canvas completed with score >= 60
- [ ] Revenue model type selected and justified
- [ ] Pricing tiers defined (at least free + paid, or trial + paid)
- [ ] Unit economics estimated (LTV, CAC, gross margin)
- [ ] Documents saved to `docs/business/`

## Notes

- Usage-based pricing needs metering infrastructure — capture as input for Phase 4
