# Phase 3: Product Definition

## Objective

Create a PRD with acceptance criteria and establish the product marketing context for Phase 8.

## Skills

| Order | Skill | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | product-manager-toolkit | Create PRD, define features, prioritize backlog |
| 2 | product-marketing-context | Create the shared marketing context document |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Product Requirements Document

Delegate to `product-manager-toolkit` with:
- Phase 1: Design document (`docs/plans/{project-name}-design.md`)
- Phase 2: Business model (`docs/business/`)

Save to `docs/product/prd.md`.

### Step 2: Product Marketing Context

Delegate to `product-marketing-context`.

Creates `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` — **gateway requirement for Phase 8**. Without this file, marketing skills lack essential context.

### Step 3: Verify Outputs

```
docs/product/
  prd.md
.claude/
  product-marketing-context.md
```

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] PRD exists with feature specs and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Features prioritized (RICE or similar)
- [ ] User stories defined for MVP features
- [ ] `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` created and populated
- [ ] User has reviewed and approved the PRD
