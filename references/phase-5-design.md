# Phase 5: Design System

## Objective

Define the product's visual language: colors, typography, spacing, components, and interaction patterns.

## Skills

| Order | Skill | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | ui-ux-pro-max | Design system creation, component design, visual language |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Create Design System

Delegate to `ui-ux-pro-max` with:
- Phase 3: PRD (user personas, product positioning)
- Phase 4: UI architecture (component hierarchy, navigation)
- Stack: frontend technology from CLAUDE.md

The skill handles all design system decisions (palette, typography, spacing, components, interactions).

### Step 2: Save

```
docs/design/
  design-system.md
```

If using a component framework (shadcn/ui, Material, etc.), document which pre-built components to use vs custom.

## Team Opportunity

Can run in parallel with Phase 4 as part of the architecture-design team. See Phase 4 reference for details.

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] Color palette defined (primary, secondary, semantic, neutrals)
- [ ] Typography scale defined
- [ ] Core component designs specified
- [ ] Design system saved to `docs/design/`
- [ ] User has approved the visual direction
